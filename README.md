# chat-app
So this was my attempt to make a working MERN Stack chat app using websocket, jwt and few other libs.
I was able to successfully connect my backend to MongoDB to fetch all the messages from my backend to frontend.
I learnt a lot about how JWT tokenization works, got a great understanding of how UserContext provider works.
Overall, it was a great learning project.

Since I've used WebSockets in the project I cannot deploy this project on Vercel or Netlify or any other provider. So if you need to test the app just simply fork this repo and pull it on your host
and simply run npm start in both client and server directory

Client - localhost:3000
Server - localhost:3001
